                        </h2>
                        <!--To add to his about:
Making bonds… (watch the video on warrior)
I think one day yoga will become an Olympic sport and it’s something I would love to represent my country doing.

                        <p>
                            As featured in OM Magazine, Max became the youngest Budokon Yoga Teacher 
                            in the World after attending an intense 200hr training course in Miami 
                            with founder, Cameron Shayne. Budokon is combined martial arts and yoga 
                            which was a perfect combo for Max as martial arts was a huge part of his 
                            upbringing. Yoga is a very different path to his previous adrenaline junkie 
                            lifestyle of snowboarding, skydiving and parkour, to name a few. His 
                            initial career goal was to pursue martial arts and attend stunt school with 
                            a view of getting into film. However, by coincidence, his concentration 
                            fell to Yoga while travelling in America. Now, over 10 years later, Max' 
                            wealth of knowledge and experience is to be gained in Canggu, Bali. 
                            Otherwise known as, The Island of Gods.

                                Yin - a feminine, passive, cooling energy - and Yang - a masculine,
                                dynamic, warming energy. Yin Yang Yoga practice uses both types of yoga to provide
                                both physical and spiritual balance. In Yin, the poses are held for a long period
                                of time to target the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, rather than focus
                                on the muscles. Yang yoga is what the Western world thinks of as yoga: that warms
                                the body and stretches and strengthens the muscles. By combining the two styles,
                                Yin to Yang improves energy and fitness while promoting relaxation and healing.

                                the mental benefits of a breath-based practice. In vinyasa yoga, the body moves in 
                                sync with the breath, creating fluid and smooth movements, so it's also known as 
                                ''flow'' yoga. Power yoga is based on these same principles, but is typically way 
                                more athletic and physical. A great choice for intermediate yogis looking to build 
                                strength and be challenged by high-energy flows. Beginners and advanced yogis will

                                <br>As Leonardo da Vinci once said, ''once you have tasted flight, you will 
                                forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward''. 
                                <br>Arm balances have a funny way of seeming impossible, until one day, they are 
                                not. On mastering arm balance techniques, the impossible is attained and flight 
                                ensues. That taste of flight captures the soul of yogis. Arm balances have 
                                amazing benefits for overall health & wellness and some poses also offer 
                                hip-opening and flexibility in the thighs and hamstrings. Mastering this style 
                                is bound to give you a major confidence boost. This is best suited to intermediate 
                                and advanced.

                                is a perfect example. There are many beautiful and innocent looking animals in Bali

                                ''My Yoga journey started in 2012, aged 16. A totally different path to my 
                                previous adrenaline junkie lifestyle of snowboarding, skydiving, parkour and 
                                calisthenics. As soon as school finished, I headed to America to pursue martial 
                                arts and attend stunt school with a view of getting into film. However, by 
                                coincidence, my mum was doing her Yoga teacher training there and I went along 
                                to one of her classes. After doing three back-to-back sessions I was hooked. 
                                Mentally and physically, I felt great! A month later the teacher asked if I was 
                                considering doing Yoga teacher training which I initially laughed off. It wasn’t 
                                until he sold me on his lifestyle that I was won over.
                                <br><hr>A week later I was on my way to Miami to attend an intense 200 hour Budokon 
                                Yoga training class. Budokon is combined martial arts and yoga which was a perfect 
                                combo for me. I paid half price because of how young I was and looking back now, 
                                it’s the best investment I ever made and would have happily paid double! On return 
                                to the UK, I re-located to London from Berkshire, Newbury where I planned to 
                                further establish my career in Yoga but my hopes and plans changed dramatically on 
                                February 11th 2018 when I had a life changing injury. I fell from a balcony, 
                                landing on my head resulting in a traumatic brain injury.
                                <br><hr>My injury was so serious that doctors said I’d never walk again. It wasn’t 
                                until they saw me doing Yoga that they realised how wrong they were! I had a bleed 
                                on my brain at the point of impact, which required surgery and 16 staples down the 
                                right side of my head. I also had a second bleed on the opposite side and a severance 
                                between the two brain halves. Additionally, I had a broken neck, fractured eye socket, 
                                other minor facial fractures, a displaced C7 & C2 vertebra and ligament & tendon 
                                damage to my right hand. I was unconscious for 11 hours and suffered post operative, 
                                amnesia for twelve days after the injury. So, that's the background to this story...''

                                    ''It’s odd how I had to learn to walk again, but Yoga was still second nature 
                                    to me. After a few days of Physiotherapy and a wobbly start to proceedings, my 
                                    arm balance and inversions training kicked in. I was soon standing on a balance 
                                    ball on one leg catching balls being thrown at me. I knew, however, that things 
                                    were not as they once were and I would require endless patience in order to make 
                                    as full a recovery as possible. This could take up to two years. After one month, 
                                    they stopped the morphine and I was physically ready to leave hospital. But the 
                                    doctors told me my brain wasn’t healing at the same pace as my body.
                                    <br><hr>I only acknowledged this when each week my brain activity would improve 
                                    significantly. Over the span of 2 years I realised how each month my thoughts 
                                    and memory improved. During my seven weeks in hospital, I was overloaded with 
                                    lists of things I could no longer do:

                                            to the susceptibility to seizures.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In addition to this initially devastating news I suffered memory 
                                    issues, which may remain with me indefinitely due to the severity of the injury 
                                    but as previously stated, this has improved over time.
                                    <br><hr>On a brighter note, I wasn't depressed, nor did I suffer mood swings which 
                                    are common symptoms after brain injury. In fact, I was grateful to be alive. I 
                                    can speak normally and I have no impairment with muscle movement. The outcome 
                                    could have been much worse. I saw many other patients trying to recover and they 
                                    were struggling both mentally and physically which was upsetting to see as most 
                                    of them were a similar age to me. This brings me on to my main point. 'Did Yoga 
                                    Save My life?' Well, it certainly helped in several ways.

                                    My consultants described my recovery as remarkable and were surprised at the speed 
                                    of my recovery. They believed that the combined mind and body qualities of a 
                                    sustained Yoga practice may be the reason I’m alive today. According to the 
                                    Consultant and Clinical Psychologist, the part of my brain that deals with speech, 
                                    logic and memory that was damaged in the accident has been aided by another part 
                                    of my brain, which they believe compensated for the injuries. They also believed 
                                    that the combined mind, body attributes of a sustained Yoga practice played a 
                                    significant role.
                                    <br><hr>As I move onward with my life and my Yoga journey, I feel humbled and thankful. 
                                    I believe I’m a better version of my former self. On leaving hospital, I knew that 
                                    I had to carry on teaching Yoga, no matter how tough the challenges I faced would be.
                                    I attended several yoga classes and taught part of a class just two weeks after my 
                                    discharge and managed my first full class just 10 weeks later. I felt exhilarated. I 
                                    have a second chance at life and will tread a more thoughtful path moving forward and 
                                    hope to persuade young people, guys in particular, that Yoga can transform lives in 
                                    so many ways. 
                                    <br><hr>I pray for others who have suffered a traumatic brain injury to recover as fully 
                                    as possible with the passage of time. I express my sincerest and deep felt thanks to 
                                    the Surgeon who saved my life and also the Paramedics, Consultants, Doctors, 
                                    Therapists, Nurses, Cooks, Cleaners, Porters, family, friends and well-wishers (many 
                                    of whom were unknown to me but helped me during my recovery with so much care).
                                    <br><hr>The experience made me far more present than I was before. I am so grateful to be 
                                    here. I’m actually glad that the accident happened because being so close to death 
                                    forced me to live life to the full and, of course, made me immensely grateful for 
                                    Yoga. I believe that without Yoga, there’s a high chance I would be paralysed or even 
                                    dead because not only did Yoga make me physically stronger, it made me mentally 
                                    stronger.
                                    <br><hr>I truly believe Yoga helps you find direction and purpose in life, whether that’s 
                                    in the corporate world or something totally different, Yoga will put you on the right 
                                    path. My purpose was changed after my accident. I know I’m on this Earth for a purpose: 
                                    to get younger people into Yoga… it might save your life!

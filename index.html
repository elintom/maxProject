                Yang to Yin
              </summary>
                Yin - a feminine, passive, cooling energy - and Yang - a masculine,
                dynamic, warming energy. Yin Yang Yoga practice uses both types of yoga to provide
                both physical and spiritual balance. In Yin, the poses are held for a long period
                of time to target the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, rather than focus
                on the muscles. Yang yoga is what the Western world thinks of as yoga: that warms
                the body and stretches and strengthens the muscles. By combining the two styles,
                Yin to Yang improves energy and fitness while promoting relaxation and healing.
                Suitable for all abilities.

                Power Vinyasa

                A full-body experience that will not only develop your athleticism, but also provide
                the mental benefits of a breath-based practice. In vinyasa yoga, the body moves in
                sync with the breath, creating fluid and smooth movements, so it's also known as
                ''flow'' yoga. Power yoga is based on these same principles, but is typically way
                more athletic and physical. A great choice for intermediate yogis looking to build
                strength and be challenged by high-energy flows. Beginners and advanced yogis will
                also benefit due to the range of challenges Max offers during this class - make it
                as challenging or relaxed as you wish.

                Arm Balances
              </summary>
                Where Max' heart lies!
                <br>As Leonardo da Vinci once said, ''once you have tasted flight, you will
                forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward''.
                <br>Arm balances have a funny way of seeming impossible, until one day, they are
                not. On mastering arm balance techniques, the impossible is attained and flight
                ensues. That taste of flight captures the soul of yogis. Arm balances have
                amazing benefits for overall health & wellness and some poses also offer
                hip-opening and flexibility in the thighs and hamstrings. Mastering this style
                is bound to give you a major confidence boost. This is best suited to intermediate
                and advanced.

                  ''My Yoga journey started in 2012, aged 16. A totally different path to my
                  previous adrenaline junkie lifestyle. As soon as I finished school, I headed
                  to America to pursue martial arts and attend stunt school with a view of
                  getting into film. However, by coincidence, my mum was doing her Yoga teacher
                  training in the UK at the same time and I went along to one of her classes.
                  After doing three back-to-back sessions I was hooked. Mentally and physically,
                  I felt great! A month later the teacher asked if I was
                  considering doing Yoga teacher training... It wasn’t until he sold me on his
                  lifestyle that I was won over.
                  <br><hr>A week later I was on my way to Miami to attend an intense 200 hour Budokon
                  Yoga training class. Budokon is combined martial arts and yoga which was a perfect
                  combo for me. On return to the UK, I re-located to London from Newbury where I planned
                  to further establish my Yoga career but my hopes and dreams were shattered dramatically
                  when I had a life changing injury. I fell from a balcony, landing on my head resulting
                  in a traumatic brain injury.
                  <br><hr>My injury was so serious that doctors said I’d never walk again. It wasn’t
                  until they saw me doing Yoga that they realised how wrong they were! I had a bleed
                  on my brain at the point of impact, which required surgery and 16 staples down the
                  right side of my head. I also had a second bleed on the opposite side and a severance
                  between the two brain halves. Additionally, I had a broken neck, fractured eye socket,
                  other minor facial fractures, a displaced C7 & C2 vertebra and ligament & tendon
                  damage to my right hand. I was unconscious for 11 hours and suffered post operative,
                  amnesia for twelve days after the injury. So, that's the background to this story...''

                                    to me. After a few days of Physiotherapy and a wobbly start to proceedings, my
                                    arm balance and inversions training kicked in. I was soon standing on a balance
                                    ball on one leg catching balls being thrown at me. I knew, however, that things
                                    were not as they once were and I would require endless patience in order to make
                                    a full a recovery. This could take up to two years. However, after one month
                                    they stopped the morphine and I was physically ready to leave hospital. But the
                                    doctors told me my brain wasn’t healing at the same pace as my body.
                                    <br><hr>I acknowledged this over the span of 2 years, realising how each month
                                    my thoughts and memory improved. During my seven weeks in hospital, I was
                                    overloaded with lists of things I could no longer do:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Driving, for 1 year
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            And to avoid getting tired which is very dangerous after brain injury due
                                            to the susceptibility to seizures.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In addition to this initially devastating news I was also told I suffer memory
                                    issues, which could have remained with me indefinitely due to the severity of
                                    the injury but, luckily, this has improved over time.

                                    My consultants described my recovery as remarkable and were surprised at the speed
                                    of my recovery. They believed that the combined mind and body qualities of a
                                    sustained Yoga practice may be the reason I’m alive today. According to the
                                    Consultant and Clinical Psychologist, the part of my brain that deals with speech,
                                    logic and memory that was damaged in the accident has been aided by another part
                                    of my brain, which they believe compensated for the injuries. They also believed
                                    that the combined mind, body attributes of a sustained Yoga practice played a
                                    significant role.
                                    <br><hr>As I move onward with my life and my Yoga journey, I feel humbled and thankful.
                                    I believe I’m a better version of my former self. On leaving hospital, I knew that
                                    I had to carry on teaching Yoga, no matter how tough the challenges I faced would be.
                                    I attended several yoga classes and taught part of a class just two weeks after my
                                    discharge and managed my first full class just 10 weeks later. I felt exhilarated. I
                                    have a second chance at life and will tread a more thoughtful path moving forward and
                                    hope to persuade young people, guys in particular, that Yoga can transform lives in
                                    so many ways.
                                    <br><hr>I pray for others who have suffered a traumatic brain injury to recover as fully
                                    as possible with the passage of time. I express my sincerest and deep felt thanks to
                                    the Surgeon who saved my life and also the Paramedics, Consultants, Doctors,
                                    Therapists, Nurses, Cooks, Cleaners, Porters, family, friends and well-wishers (many
                                    of whom were unknown to me but helped me during my recovery with so much care).
                                    <br><hr>The experience made me far more present than I was before. I am so grateful to be
                                    here. I’m actually glad that the accident happened because being so close to death
                                    forced me to live life to the full and, of course, made me immensely grateful for
                                    Yoga. I believe that without Yoga, there’s a high chance I would be paralysed or even
                                    dead because not only did Yoga make me physically stronger, it made me mentally
                                    stronger.
                                    <br><hr>I truly believe Yoga helps you find direction and purpose in life, whether that’s
                                    in the corporate world or something totally different, Yoga will put you on the right
                                    path. My purpose was changed after my accident. I know I’m on this Earth for a purpose:
                                    to get younger people into Yoga… it might save your life!
